# nim-kad-dht

I want to write a Kademlia DHT in Nim.

- Get better intuition for Kademlia by writing an implementation
- Get better at P2P coding in practice by solving a well-known problem
- Get better at Nim

As well as:
- Hopefully useful for Vac/protocol efforts
- Hopefully useful for libp2p efforts
